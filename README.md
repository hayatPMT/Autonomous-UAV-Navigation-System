## 📖 Description
The Autonomous UAV Navigation System lets you navigate drones effortlessly. This system includes real-time 2.5D occupancy-grid mapping, A* global path planning, and the merging of depth and LiDAR sensor data. It helps avoid obstacles in complex urban areas. This software works well with ROS 2, PX4 Offboard control, and Gazebo simulation for thorough testing.

## 🚀 Getting Started
You can get started in a few simple steps. Follow this guide to download and run the software.

1. **Check Your Setup**  
   To use the Autonomous UAV Navigation System, ensure your computer meets these requirements:

   - Windows: Search for "Autonomous UAV Navigation System" in your Start Menu.  
   - macOS: Locate it in the Applications folder.  
   - Linux: Run it from the terminal or find it in your applications menu.

7. **Connect Your Drone**  
   Ensure your drone is ready for connection. Follow the drone's user manual to make sure it is set up correctly.

8. **Start Navigation**  
   Open the Autonomous UAV Navigation System. Follow the prompts on-screen to configure settings for your drone.

## ⚙️ Features
- **Real-Time Mapping:** Generate and update a 2.5D occupancy grid map while flying.
- **Path Planning:** Use the A* algorithm for efficient flight paths.
- **Obstacle Avoidance:** Dynamic fusion of depth and LiDAR data to navigate around objects.
- **ROS 2 Integration:** Full compatibility with ROS 2 for advanced users.
- **Simulation:** Test your setups in Gazebo for safe pre-flight checks.

## 🚀 Usage
The application is designed to be user-friendly. After you connect your drone, you'll mainly deal with three key areas:
- **Mapping:** Start your flight and watch the map build in real-time.
- **Planning:** Input your desired goal, and the system calculates the best path.
- **Monitoring:** Keep an eye on the drone’s data, such as battery status and distance to obstacles.

## 🔧 Troubleshooting
- **Cannot Connect to Drone:** Ensure both your computer and drone are on the same network. Check that your drone is powered on.
- **Application Crashes:** Make sure your computer meets the requirements. Check for updates or re-download the software.
- **Mapping Issues:** Confirm the sensors are functioning correctly. Restart the application and try again.
